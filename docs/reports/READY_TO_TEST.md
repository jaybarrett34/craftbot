---

## üöÄ HOW TO TEST - FOLLOW THESE STEPS

### Step 1: Read START_HERE.md
```bash
cd /Users/bigballsinyourjaws/Documents/Projects/mcp/craftbot-mcp
cat START_HERE.md
```

This is your complete guide from zero to working system.

### Step 2: Run Pre-Flight Check
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/preflight-check.sh
```

This checks:
- Node.js version
- npm dependencies
- Ollama running
- Ports available
- Configuration files

**Expected:** All checks should be GREEN or YELLOW (not RED)

### Step 3: Setup Minecraft Server (if needed)
```bash
./scripts/setup-minecraft-server.sh
```

This will:
- Download Fabric server for MC 1.20.1
- Configure RCON automatically
- Install Fabric API mod
- Takes ~5-10 minutes

**You can skip this if you already have a Minecraft server with RCON enabled.**

### Step 4: Setup Ollama
```bash
./scripts/setup-ollama.sh
```

This will:
- Check Ollama is running
- Pull qwen2.5:14b-instruct model (~8.5GB download)
- Test the model
- Verify XML tag generation

**Expected:** Should show "‚úÖ Setup complete" at the end

### Step 5: Configure Environment
```bash
# Copy template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit with your settings
nano .env
```

**Required settings:**
```bash
RCON_HOST=localhost
RCON_PORT=25575
RCON_PASSWORD=craftbot_rcon_pass  # Match your server.properties
MC_LOG_PATH=./minecraft-server/logs/latest.log
OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:14b-instruct
```

### Step 6: Start Services

**Terminal 1: Minecraft Server**
```bash
./scripts/start-minecraft.sh
# Wait for "Done" message (1-2 minutes)
# Press Ctrl+C to stop watching logs (server keeps running)
```

**Terminal 2: Ollama (if not running)**
```bash
ollama serve
```

**Terminal 3: MCP Backend**
```bash
npm run server
```

Look for these messages:
```
‚úì MCP Server started on port 3000
‚úì WebSocket server running
‚úì RCON connected to localhost:25575
‚úì Watching log file: ./minecraft-server/logs/latest.log
```

**Terminal 4: Frontend**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Look for:
```
VITE ready in XXX ms
Local: http://localhost:5173/
```

### Step 7: Run Integration Tests
```bash
# In a new terminal
npm run test:integration
```

**Expected:** All 8 tests should PASS
- Test 1: RCON Connection ‚úÖ
- Test 2: Ollama Connection ‚úÖ
- Test 3: Chat Monitor ‚úÖ
- Test 4: Command Validator ‚úÖ
- Test 5: State Fetcher ‚úÖ
- Test 6: LLM Parser ‚úÖ
- Test 7: WebSocket ‚úÖ
- Test 8: Full Flow ‚úÖ

### Step 8: Connect to Minecraft

1. Launch Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1
2. Multiplayer ‚Üí Add Server
3. Server Address: `localhost`
4. Join the server

### Step 9: Give Yourself OP
```minecraft
/op YourMinecraftUsername
```

### Step 10: Test Console Entity

Type in Minecraft chat:
```
Hello console, are you there?
```

**Watch Terminal 3 (MCP Backend) for:**
```
[Chat Monitor] Detected message: <YourName> Hello console, are you there?
[Conversation Queue] Enqueued for: console
[Ollama Client] Sending to qwen2.5:14b-instruct...
[Ollama Client] Response received (2.1s)
[LLM Parser] Extracted: say=1
[RCON] Executing: tellraw @a [{"text":"[AI] Console: ..."}]
```

**Expected in Minecraft:**
```
[AI] Console: Yes! I'm here and ready to help. What do you need?
```

### Step 11: Test NPC Entity

Spawn an NPC:
```minecraft
/summon armor_stand ~ ~ ~ {CustomName:'{"text":"[AI] Bob the Merchant"}',CustomNameVisible:1b,NoGravity:1b,ShowArms:1b,Invulnerable:1b}
```

Stand near it and say:
```
Hello Bob, what do you sell?
```

**Expected:**
```
[AI] Bob the Merchant: Greetings! I sell rare items and enchanted gear. What interests you?
```

### Step 12: Test Command Execution

Ask console:
```
Console, can you give me a diamond?
```

**Watch logs for:**
```
[LLM Parser] Extracted: function=1, say=1
[LLM Parser] Function: /give @p minecraft:diamond 1
[Command Validator] Validating for entity: console (level: admin)
[Command Validator] Command ALLOWED
[RCON] Executing: /give @p minecraft:diamond 1
```

**Expected:**
- You receive 1 diamond in inventory
- Console says something like "Here's your diamond!"

### Step 13: Open Frontend

Visit: http://localhost:5173

**Check:**
- ‚úÖ Connection Status: üü¢ Connected (top right)
- ‚úÖ Entity Config Sidebar (left) shows console entity
- ‚úÖ Log Viewer (right) shows chat messages in real-time
- ‚úÖ All conversations visible

### Step 14: Test Permission System

In frontend:
1. Click "Add Entity"
2. Create NPC named "TestNPC"
3. Set permission level to "readonly"
4. Save

In Minecraft, ask TestNPC:
```
TestNPC, give me a diamond
```

**Expected:**
```
[AI] TestNPC: I don't have permission to give items. I can only observe and chat!
```

**Check logs:**
```
[Command Validator] Command DENIED: insufficient permissions
```

## üìä What to Watch

### MCP Backend Console (Terminal 3)

**Normal Operation:**
```
[INFO] RCON connected
[INFO] Chat Monitor started
[Chat Monitor] Detected message: <Player> hello
[Conversation Queue] Processing for: console
[Ollama Client] Sending prompt...
[Ollama Client] Response: 2.3s
[LLM Parser] Extracted tags successfully
[Command Validator] Command allowed
[RCON] Executing: tellraw ...
```

**Errors to Investigate:**
```
[ERROR] RCON connection failed
[ERROR] Ollama timeout
[ERROR] Command validation failed
[WARN] Model not found
```

### Frontend Console (Browser DevTools)

**Normal:**
```
[WebSocket] Connected
[WebSocket] Received: {"type":"log", ...}
[API] Config loaded
```

**Errors:**
```
[WebSocket] Connection failed
[API] Request failed
```

---

## üîß Quick Troubleshooting

### "RCON connection failed"
```bash
# Check Minecraft server is running
pgrep -f fabric-server-launch

# Check RCON password matches
cat .env | grep RCON_PASSWORD
cat minecraft-server/server.properties | grep rcon.password
```

### "Ollama timeout" or "Model not found"
```bash
# Check Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Pull model if missing
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b-instruct
```

### "Chat not detected"
```bash
# Verify log path
cat .env | grep MC_LOG_PATH

# Check log file exists
tail -f minecraft-server/logs/latest.log

# Type in Minecraft and see if it appears
```

### "No AI response"
```bash
# Check all services running
npm run test:health

# Check logs for errors
npm run debug
```

### "WebSocket won't connect"
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check frontend URL
cat .env | grep VITE_WS_URL
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Keep logs visible** - Run `npm run debug` to watch everything
2. **Start small** - Test console entity first, then add NPCs
3. **Check permissions** - Use frontend to verify entity settings
4. **Monitor performance** - First LLM call takes 10-15s (model loading)
5. **Read console logs** - They tell you exactly what's happening
6. **Use test prompts** - See `test-prompts.txt` for examples

---

## üéØ Next Steps After Testing

Once basic testing works:

1. **Customize NPCs** - Create merchants, guards, quest givers
2. **Tune personalities** - Edit system prompts for different characters
3. **Set permissions** - Configure what each NPC can do
4. **Build content** - Create quests, dialogues, interactions
5. **Monitor logs** - Watch for issues or unexpected behavior
6. **Optimize** - Adjust caching, rate limits, model temperature
7. **Scale up** - Add more NPCs, more complex interactions

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **First LLM call** takes 10-15 seconds (model loading)
- **Subsequent calls** are 2-5 seconds
- **Keep Ollama running** in a separate terminal
- **Frontend must refresh** if backend restarts
- **RCON password** must match between .env and server.properties
- **Log file path** must be absolute or relative to project root

---

## üöÄ You're Ready!

Everything is set up. Follow the steps above and you should have:
- AI NPCs responding in Minecraft
- Commands executing based on permissions
- Real-time logs in the frontend
- A complete AI-powered Minecraft experience

**Start with Step 1: Read START_HERE.md**

Good luck! üéÆü§ñ
