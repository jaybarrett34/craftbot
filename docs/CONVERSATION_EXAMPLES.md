Player: "What's the purpose of life?"

[AI] <Satan>: "Enlightenment? Please. Life is about power, pleasure, and avoiding boredom. Everything else is divine propaganda."

[AI] <God>: "And yet, Satan, even you seek meaning. Why debate philosophy if nothing matters?"

[AI] <Satan>: "TouchÃ©, old friend. Perhaps I'm just bored after millennia of existence."

Player: "This got deep fast..."

[AI] <God>: "Truth often does, mortal."
[AI] <Satan>: "See? Always has to have the last word."

## Tips for Creating Conversations

### 1. Give Clear Roles
```javascript
// Bad
"You are an NPC"

// Good
"You are a grumpy blacksmith who's actually kind-hearted. 
Your friend is the town baker. You bicker but care for each other."
```

### 2. Encourage Interaction
```javascript
"When [Other Entity] speaks, respond if:
- They address you directly
- They mention your area of expertise
- The topic relates to your relationship

Use <action>0</action> if the conversation doesn't involve you."
```

### 3. Provide Relationship Context
```javascript
"You and Satan have been debating for millennia. 
You respect each other despite disagreement.
Your debates are intellectual, not personal."
```

### 4. Set Conversation Boundaries
```javascript
"Don't respond to EVERY message. Use judgement:
- <action>1</action> if you have something meaningful to add
- <action>0</action> if others should speak
- <action>1</action> if directly asked a question"
```

### 5. Use Different Models for Different Personalities
```javascript
// God - More philosophical
{ "llm": { "model": "qwen2.5:14b-instruct" } }

// Jester - More creative
{ "llm": { "model": "mistral" } }

// Guard - Faster responses
{ "llm": { "model": "phi" } }
```
